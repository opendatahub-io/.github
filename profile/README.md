### Welcome to Open Data Hub :wave:

Open Data Hub (ODH) is an open source project that provides open source AI tools for running large and distributed AI workloads on the OpenShift Container Platform. Currently, the Open Data Hub project provides open source tools for distributed AI and Machine Learning (ML) workflows, Jupyter Notebook development environment and monitoring. The Open Data Hub project roadmap offers a view on new tools and integration the project developers are planning to add.  

Included in the Open Data Hub core deployment is several open source components, which can be individially enabled. They include:

- Jupyter Notebooks
- ODH Dashboard
- Data Science Pipelines Operator
- Model Mesh Serving

For further information refer to the [architecture](https://opendatahub.io/docs/architecture.html) and [release notes](https://opendatahub.io/docs/roadmap/release-notes.html).
