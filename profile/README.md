## Welcome to Open Data Hub :wave:

Open Data Hub (ODH) is an open source project that provides open source AI tools for running large and distributed AI workloads on the OpenShift Container Platform. Currently, the Open Data Hub project provides open source tools for distributed AI and Machine Learning (ML) workflows, Jupyter Notebook development environment and monitoring. The Open Data Hub project roadmap offers a view on new tools and integration the project developers are planning to add.  

Included in the Open Data Hub core deployment are several open source components, which can be individually deployed and managed by the opendatahub-operator [DataScienceCluster](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator?tab=readme-ov-file#example-datasciencecluster) CustomResource
